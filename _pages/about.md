Hi all! I came from Italy and I work as a developer for an insurance company.

## Skills

In 1999 I've started to develop some tools and small applications on Delphi.

From 1993 to 2005 I've mostly developed interactive and batch COBOL programs under MVS CICS and AS/400 hosts.
From 2005 to now I develop almost exclusively on Delphi for a big insurance company.

## The nickname

It derives from the ancient Latin name of the village where I was born. There is no reference to the Roman emperor with the same name (which i discovered later).
